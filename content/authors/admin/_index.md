I am currently a master's student in High-Performance Graphics and Games Engineering at the University of Leeds. I have been interested in working on graphics engines since a young age after laying my hands on [my first videogame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(2005_video_game))!

After my master's degree I will be looking for either PhD openings in computer graphics, or graduate jobs which will provide me with exciting challenges and opportunities.

In my spare time I enjoy martial arts, Japanese learning, and enjoying a variety of literature!
