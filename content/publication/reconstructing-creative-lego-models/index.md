abstract: Lego is one of the most successful toys in the world. Being able to
  scan, analyse and reconstruct Lego models has many applications, for example
  studying creativity. In this paper, from a set of 2D input images, we create a
  monolithic mesh, representing a physical 3D Lego model as input, and split it
  in to its known components such that the output of the program can be used to
  completely reconstruct the input model, brick for brick. We present a novel,
  fully automatic pipeline to reconstruct Lego models in 3D from 2D images;
  A-DBSCAN, an angular variant of DBSCAN, useful for grouping both parallel and
  anti-parallel vectors; and a method for reducing the problem of non-Manhattan
  reconstruction to that of Manhattan reconstruction. We evaluate the presented
  approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on a set of Lego duck models
  from a public data set, and show that the algorithm is able to identify and
  reconstruct the Lego models successfully.
