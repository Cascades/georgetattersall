This project is a little different from the other projects on here so far. While I have always aspired to enter the video games industry, specifically in a graphics or engine role, I also have a love of Japanese traditional artwork, ukiyo-e (oo-ki-yo-eh).

A few years ago I was in a C++ job, learning lots about the language and its surrounding technologies full time, and I found myself wanting to develop myself in other technologies in my spare time. At the same time I was also frustrated at the lack of visual maps of Japanese woodblock print locations plotted on a map plotted on maps that were available on the internet. This may sound peculiar, but these prints are often done in series either around a specific location (Mt. Fuji or modern day Tokyo), or along a journey from city to city.

A good example of this is Hokusai's "Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō". In this series, the painter of "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" (pictured below) travelled along a route named "Tōkaidō" which at the time was the most important route in Japan, connecting Tokyo to Kyoto, it's two biggest cities. Along this route lay a number of "stations" which would have been able to provide food, accommodation, and rest to travellers on their week of travel. At many of the station Hokusai would illustrate what he saw for publishing nationally as cheaply and affordably as a modern day newspaper.
