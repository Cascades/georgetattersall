I have been doing various projects since mid-last year, however have not had the time to do a proper showcase/write-up on them yet. I should have some spare time from 29/03/2021, so hopefully some of the projects will be released the following weeks.

I plan to do a write up on:

* Homebrew Rasterizer
* Homebrew Ray-caster
* Realtime IK solver for BVH input
* 2D SPH solver
* Mesh decimation tool
* Mesh smoothing tool using subdivision surfaces
* Potentially a few others which I'm undecided on

And this post should hold me accountable!
